        <p>Welcome to our Senior Design page! We are a team of George Mason University Undergraduates who are working on a joint project with INOVA Fairfax hospital to develop a novel method for cerebrospinal fluid shunt blockage. To find out more about out design journey please, read on...</p>

<p>The acronym represents the first letter of each of our first names, arranged in an order the resulted only order that sounded pleasing to our ears. The name also coincidentally turns out to be an alliteration when used with the acronym for bioengineering, here at Mason. This is to say "BAIN BENG", as in we're hoping to shoot a bullseye with our innovative design for the noninvasive detection of medical shunts that can be reproduced regardless of shunt class. Our mentors on this project at Dr. Siddhartha Sikdar,PhD, who is an expert on ultrasound technology, and Dr. Mahesh Shenai, MD.</p>

<p>Previous work has been published from our Lab which details the creation of a novel noninvasive shunt detection system using ultrasound technology. The major problem that arises while using this method is the reproducible placement of the ultrasound transducer. This is a problem which we hope to solve.</p>
